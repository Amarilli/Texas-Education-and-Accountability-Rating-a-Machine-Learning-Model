### Project Overview:

Question to answer: Can a school's accountability rating be predicted?

This is the third part of our team project focused on [Texas ISDs](https://github.com/mariahmclelan/TexasISDs). We aim to develop a Machine Learning Model to predict a school's accountability rating. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) assesses public schools and districts based on state accountability requirements, accrediting public schools in Texas at the district level for grades K-12. The Texas Administrative Code (TAC) outlines the rules for accrediting school districts, specifying four statuses: **Accredited**, **Accredited-Warned**, **Accredited-Probation**, and **Not Accredited-Revoked**. The TAC rules encompass accreditation standards and sanctions, including definitions, purpose, and oversight appointments[^1].

Our team is undertaking a challenging task: investigating the feasibility of predicting a school's accountability rating using a custom MongoDB database and Machine Learning. This complex and intricate endeavor requires our collective expertise and dedication.
